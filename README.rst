Summary
=======

pyre2 is a Python extension that wraps
`Google's RE2 regular expression library
<http://code.google.com/p/re2/>`_.

This version of pyre2 is similar to the one you'd
find at `facebook's github repository <http://github.com/facebook/pyre2/>`_
except that the stated goal of this version is to be a *drop-in replacement* for
the ``re`` module.


This version differs from `axiak <https://github.com/axiak/pyre2>`_ in the 
following way:

* Python 3 support (untested in Python 2 but shoud work)
* Uses the type of the pattern to determine the encoding of the output.
Mixing types will get you zero output but it will work, as it would using 
standard lib re module:

* bytes pattern arg + bytes string --> bytes output
* unicode pattern arg + unicode string --> unicode output
* unicode pattern arg + bytes string --> unicode output

* Builds statically against google/re2 included as a subtree instead of a library::

    git subtree add --prefix re2/src/re2 git@github.com:google/re2.git master --squash

* Updated cython C++ code for newer cython features.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

The stated goal of this module is to be a drop-in replacement for ``re``. 
My hope is that some will be able to go to the top of their module and put::

    try:
        import re2 as re
    except ImportError:
        import re

That being said, there are features of the ``re`` module that this module may
never have. For example, ``RE2`` does not handle lookahead assertions
(``(?=...)``).
For this reason, the module will automatically fall back to the original 
``re`` module if there is a regex that it cannot handle.

However, there are times when you may want to be notified of a failover. For this reason,
I'm adding the single function ``set_fallback_notification`` to the module.
Thus, you can write::

    try:
        import re2 as re
    except ImportError:
        import re
    else:
	re.set_fallback_notification(re.FALLBACK_WARNING)

And in the above example, ``set_fallback_notification`` can handle 3 values:
``re.FALLBACK_QUIETLY`` (default), ``re.FALLBACK_WARNING`` (raises a warning), and
``re.FALLBACK_EXCEPTION`` (which raises an exception).

Installation
============

To install, you must first install the prerequisites:

* The Python development headers
* A build environment with ``clang++`` or ``g++``
* cython

Then run::
    
    $ python setup.py install


Unicode Support
===============

In Python 3 Unicode and Bytes strings using ASCII character set run almost as 
fast as each other (semi-experimentally proven) and for most loads at least 
twice as fast. For searching on UTF-8 Unicode using non-ascii, use the 
``re.UNICODE`` flag to get the results properly encoded and spans properly 
calculated.

Internally, all Unicode strings get encoded to UTF-8 and are manipulated as
bytestrings until a call for results is made.   

bytes strings in gives bytes strings out
unicode in gives unicode out

Tests
=====

run tests in ``tests/``
More tests welcomes

Missing Features
================

Currently the features missing are:

* If you use substitution methods without a callback, a non 0/1 maxsplit 
argument is not supported.
